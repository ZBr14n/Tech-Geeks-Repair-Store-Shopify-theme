## What is this?
This is a Shopify theme/store build from scratch. 

## What did I learn?
I learned how to navigate through Shopify's hosted platform by building a theme/store from the ground up without any boilerplate code.
At first, I was confused by how Liquid templates work after checking out various themes that use lots of boilerplate code. By starting everything from scratch, I was able to understand how sections, snippets, and layouts work in terms of organizing Liquid files. 

Along the way, I learned how to build a responsive website with a grid layout, while using advance tools like Sass and Prepos for generating CSS files. 


## Tools used:
### HTML
### CSS / Sass
### Prepos for compiling assets
### Shopify's Liquid Template
### Shopify's ThemeKit for file/server sync on VSCode Editor.
